# TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT!

You've learned how to code, which is cool. But in order for someone to hire
you, they have to *know* that you know how to code. That's where technical
assessments come in. There are three types of technical assessment:

  1. Automated Tech Test
  1. Take-Home Challenge
  1. Technical interview

Depending on the company, you will have to do one, two, or all three of these
kinds of assessments in sequential order as you progress through the interview process. Generally speaking, the larger the company, the more technical assessments you'll have to go through.

## 1. AUTOMATED TECH TESTS

The company will send you a link to a collection of questions that you'll have
to answer inside of a given time period, usually one to three hours. It'll
likely look something like [this](https://www.hackerrank.com/test/sample)

#### BEFORE THE TEST

- Get familiar and comfortable with the coding environment
- Get your notes and resources in order
- Make sure your physical environment is comfortable and quiet
- Plan to do the assessment at a time where you won't be interrupted

#### DURING THE TEST

- RELAX!
- Read all the questions first
- Think before you code
- Be mindful of your time

#### HOW IT'S JUDGED

These assessments are evaluated by the automatically. If you write code that passes every test, you're good to go. But because it's timed, it's not uncommon for candidates to have a test or two that their code cannot pass. THAT'S OK! Just like the tests you took back in school, getting 100% is great but you still "pass" if you get 90% or 80%. Do you best, and comment your thoughts in case an actual person takes a look at your test.

## 2. TAKE-HOME CHALLENGE

This will be the most familiar type of assessment for you coming off of a
boot camp because it's basically the same as the projects you've been doing.
They'll give you a project to build with certain parameters to fulfill such as
"Build out a nav bar for X site" or "Create a stock ticker app using Y API".
You'll typically have a few days or maybe a full week to complete the challenge,
depending on the scope of the challenge.

#### BEFORE THE ASSESSMENT

- Carefully read the parameters
- ASK QUESTIONS
- Plan out your MVP, starting from the parameters themselves
- Plan out an prioritize your post MVP features
- Schedule some milestones

#### DURING THE ASSESSMENT

- Function first!
- Make it look nice
- Clean up/refactor
- Add post-MVP one at a time, function first, then style, then clean up
- STICK TO YOUR MILESTONES

#### HOW IT'S JUDGED

First and foremost, they want to see that the thing you built works. Before they
even take a look at your code, they're going to look at the project as a user.
That means you need to hit every single basic parameter laid out in the
challenge and make the user experience clean and easy. Try and make your styling
simple and straightforward and don't be afraid to take the styling for an old
project and simply rework it for this one. 

After that, they're going to take a look under the hood to see the quality of
your code. If you have two candidates who both aced this assessment but
Candidate Apple's code is sloppy spaghetti with a `console.log` every 5 lines
and Candidate Banana's code is clean, has good semantic choices, and helpful
comments where appropriate, Candidate Banana is going to get the job.

Once your MVP is functional, the user experience is professional, and the code
is nice and clean, other little factors may separate you from the bunch, like
including a professional looking readme, maybe even listing and including the
wireframes for those post-mvp features that you didn't have time to complete.

## 3. TECHNICAL INTERVIEW

In this type of assessment, you'll be speaking in person or over a video chat
with a technically proficient person (often your potential boss) who will give
you a problem and see how you solve it in real time, either by writing out code on a white board or coding live through a paired programming platform. Some people think this is the most intimidating kind of assessment but I'll let you in on a secret:

They want you to do well! You can use the person you're interviewing with as a resource!

#### BEFORE THE ASSESSMENT

- Get comfortable writing code by hand
- Google your interviewer
- ASK QUESTIONS

#### DURING THE ASSESSMENT

- RELAX
- Think out loud
- ASK QUESTIONS

#### HOW IT'S JUDGED

If you've made it to this stage of the interview process, they already know that
you have some minimum level of technical proficiency. So why put you on the spot
live like this? Primarily, it's to see your thought process as you approach a
problem. To that end, you want to vocalize your thought process as much as
possible and pull out as much information as you can from the interviewer. For
example, if they tell you to write a program that tells if a given string is a
palindrome, ask questions like "Does case matter?", "Should I account for
punctuation? Spaces?", etc. Do this BEFORE you write a single thing or even
start thinking about a solution. 

Once you have a solution, try and volunteer ways your solution could be
improved. Ask them things like "if we were going to optimize this, would it
be for time or space complexity?" (and be prepared to talk through how to do
either). Generally you want to impress upon them that
you're the kind of person who isn't looking for **a** solution. You're looking
for **the best** solution.
